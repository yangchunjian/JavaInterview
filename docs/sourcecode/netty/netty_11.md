## 总结11

### 包装catch错误
 
```java

/**
 * A {@link NameResolver} that resolves an {@link InetSocketAddress} using JDK's built-in domain name lookup mechanism.
 * Note that this resolver performs a blocking name lookup from the caller thread.
 */
public class DefaultNameResolver extends SimpleNameResolver<InetSocketAddress> {

    public DefaultNameResolver(EventExecutor executor) {
        super(executor);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean doIsResolved(InetSocketAddress address) {
        return !address.isUnresolved();
    }

    @Override
    protected void doResolve(InetSocketAddress unresolvedAddress, Promise<InetSocketAddress> promise) throws Exception {
        try {
            promise.setSuccess(
                    new InetSocketAddress(
                            InetAddress.getByName(unresolvedAddress.getHostString()),
                            unresolvedAddress.getPort()));
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            promise.setFailure(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### 扩展泛型接口

     * failed.
